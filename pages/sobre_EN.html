        <h2>OUR VISION</h2>

        <p>Our vision is to emerge as the best electronic journal of nursing in Latin America, through recognition by
            the major international indexing databases and through its inalienable defense of excellence, accuracy and
            ethical precepts in publications in the field of health.</p>
